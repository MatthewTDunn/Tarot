During the day, you must ensure that business remains as usual, catering to a diverse clientele seeking guidance and insight. Shuffle and lay the cards with care, channeling your grandmother's wisdom and nurturing your own intuition as you decipher the hidden meanings within the ancient deck. Every decision you make and every reading you deliver will shape the fate of your customers and unveil the secrets they hold.

However, as twilight descends, the veil between the mundane and the magical grows thinner. With the setting sun, the once-familiar shop transforms into a place brimming with extraordinary possibilities and hidden wonders. As the moon casts its spell, you may stumble upon mysterious occurrences, encounter enigmatic characters, and even experience otherworldly phenomena. The line between reality and imagination blurs, presenting unforeseen challenges and remarkable discoveries.
